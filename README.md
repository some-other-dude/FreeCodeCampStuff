# README FILE FOR FREE CODE CAMP ALGORITHM SERIES

## Development Environment
Most of these little apps are in JavaScript/ES5 unless there is a compelling reason to use ES6/2016.  I code in Atom on a Mac.  Debug in Chrome.  Everything is pretty vanilla here.

## Exercises
### Algorithms Series
These are all located in the algorithms folder.  I use atom-live-reload to see changes in the browser console, so there is a _very_ simple index.html file in the algorithms folder.
#### 001 Reverse a string
Give it a string and out pops the reverse.

#### 002 Factorial of a number
Recursion!!!

#### 003 Palindromes
A quick little ditty to check for palindromes.  It can stand a bit of refactoring to get rid of a couple of variables, but works pretty well.  I used map() and some string manipulation to make a clean string of characters and then a reverse copy.  Simple comparison after that.
